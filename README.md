# EconomicGrowth_ClassificationAnalysis


## problem
The assignment requires the development of a Python script to apply three different classification algorithms to explain whether regions' economies grew by more than 5% based on OECD data from 2019. The script should enable the evaluation of clustering algorithm performance by computing standard goodness measures for classification. The goal is to explore the effectiveness of classification methods such as Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Multilayer Perceptron Classifiers in predicting economic growth in regions. 


## Solution 
The Python script successfully addresses the assignment's requirements by implementing three classification algorithms—Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Multilayer Perceptron—to predict whether regions' economies grew by more than 5%. The script handles data preprocessing, including merging datasets and one-hot encoding categorical variables. It then splits the data for training and testing before evaluating each model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix. The interpretation of results reveals that the Random Forest Classifier outperforms the other models, exhibiting higher accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The detailed analysis of each model's performance provides valuable insights into their strengths and weaknesses, aiding in the selection of an appropriate classification algorithm for predicting economic growth in regions.
